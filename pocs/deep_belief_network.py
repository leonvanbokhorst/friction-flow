"""Deep Belief Network (DBN) Implementation and Experimentation

This module implements a Deep Belief Network, which is a generative probabilistic model
composed of multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). DBNs are particularly
effective for unsupervised feature learning and dimensionality reduction.

Key Concepts:
- DBNs learn to probabilistically reconstruct their inputs through multiple layers
- Training occurs layer by layer (greedy layer-wise training)
- Each layer captures increasingly abstract features of the data
- The network learns a joint probability distribution over visible and hidden units

Architecture:
- Multiple RBM layers stacked together
- Each RBM learns to encode its input layer into a hidden representation
- Bottom layers capture low-level features (e.g., edges in images)
- Higher layers capture increasingly abstract concepts

Training Process:
1. Train first RBM on raw input data
2. Use first RBM's hidden layer activations as input for second RBM
3. Repeat for all subsequent layers
4. This greedy layer-wise training builds increasingly abstract representations

Typical Applications:
- Dimensionality reduction
- Feature learning
- Image recognition
- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection

Example Usage:
    # For MNIST-like data (28x28 pixel images = 784 dimensions)
    dbn = DBN([784, 256, 64])  # Reducing dimensionality: 784 -> 256 -> 64
    dbn.pretrain(data, epochs=5)  # Unsupervised pretraining

class RBM:
    """Restricted Boltzmann Machine implementation.
    
    An RBM is a two-layer neural network that learns a probability distribution
    over its inputs. It consists of:
    - A visible layer representing the input data
    - A hidden layer learning features from the input
    - Bidirectional connections between layers (weights)
    - No connections within each layer (hence "restricted")
    
    The learning process involves:
    1. Forward pass (visible to hidden) - encode input
    2. Backward pass (hidden to visible) - reconstruct input
    3. Update weights to minimize reconstruction error
    
    Key Properties:
    - Stochastic binary units (neurons)
    - Symmetric connections between layers
    - No connections within layers
    - Uses contrastive divergence for training
