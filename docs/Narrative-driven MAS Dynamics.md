# Narrative-Driven MAS Dynamics Simulator

## 1. Core Agent Structure
- Remove all numeric state tracking
- Replace technical state management with narrative descriptions
- Focus on story-driven personality expression
- Use semantic interpretation rather than state machines

## 2. Essential Components
- Narrative Identity (who they are, their story)
- Experiential Memory (subjective experiences)
- Interaction Engine (how they express themselves)
- Worldview (how they interpret things)
- Personality Expression (how they naturally behave)

## 3. Key Interactions
- Semantic message interpretation
- Narrative response generation
- Experience formation
- Memory integration
- Personality expression

## 4. What to Remove/Simplify
- Remove all numeric state tracking
- Remove complex network effects
- Remove resource management systems
- Remove technical state machines
- Remove quantitative metrics
- Simplify emergence to basic patterns

## Proposed Narrative-Driven Structure

### 1. Agent Core

#### Identity
- Personal narrative (background, experiences, beliefs)
- Core personality traits (as stories, not numbers)
- Behavioral patterns (described narratively)
- Values and motivations (as meaningful stories)

#### Memory
- Significant experiences
- Relationship histories
- Key emotional moments
- Learning experiences

#### Worldview
- How they see others
- What they believe about the world
- Their understanding of their place
- Their interpretation filters

### 2. Interaction Model

#### Input
- Receive semantic information
- Interpret through personal lens
- Connect to personal experiences
- Form subjective meaning

#### Processing
- Filter through personality
- Compare with past experiences
- Apply personal values
- Form emotional response

#### Output
- Express through character lens
- Share subjective experience
- Communicate authentically
- Reveal appropriate emotion

### 3. Learning/Adaptation

#### Experience Formation
- Create meaningful narratives
- Connect to existing stories
- Form emotional associations
- Integrate into worldview

#### Pattern Recognition
- Notice recurring themes
- Identify relationship patterns
- Understand emotional triggers
- See behavior cycles

## Key Implementation Principles

### 1. Everything is a Story
- No numeric states, only narratives
- No quantitative measures, only qualitative descriptions
- No technical states, only experiential states
- No resource counting, only meaningful impact

### 2. Interaction is Interpretation
- Messages are interpreted through personal lens
- Responses come from character and experience
- Learning happens through story integration
- Growth comes from narrative development

### 3. Personality is Expression
- Character emerges from consistent patterns
- Behavior flows from personal narrative
- Responses reflect core identity
- Growth maintains character consistency
